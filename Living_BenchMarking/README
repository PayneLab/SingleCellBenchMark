Running the Living Benchmarking Program:

In order to run your program's output to our benchmarked data you will use the Living_Benchmarking_Template.ipynb notebook.
You will first need to run the same data through your program. Begin by downloading six 2ng and six 0.2ng files from MassIVE (MSV000087524). The benchmarking
program will be working with the peptides, so you will need find the output file that gives the peptides. The instructions in the notebook will direct you to create 
the .csv files that have a "scan", "decoy", "peptide", and some type of probability column. Follow these instructions to create files in the correct format to run 
through the benchmarking program.

When you are done, two graphs will save to your computer as '2ng_benchmark_graph.png' and '0.2ng_benchmark_graph.png'. This will show how many PSMs at or below a 1% 
FDR cutoff each tool, including yours, is finding for the relative raw files.
